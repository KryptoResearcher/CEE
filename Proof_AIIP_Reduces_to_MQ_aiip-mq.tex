\begin{theorem}[AIIP Reduces to MQ]\label{thm:aiip-mq}
    The Affine Iterated Inversion Problem is polynomial-time reducible to the problem of solving a random system of multivariate quadratic equations over $\mathbb{F}_q$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]
    Given an AIIP instance $(f, n, y)$ where $f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^d a_i x^i$, we construct an MQ system by introducing intermediate variables $z_0, z_1, \ldots, z_n$ where $z_i$ 
    represents $f^{[i]}(x)$.

    The key observation is that each iteration $z_i = f(z_{i-1})$ can be expressed as polynomial equations of degree $d$. For $d = 2$, these are already quadratic. For 
    $d > 2$, we introduce auxiliary variables to reduce higher-degree monomials to quadratic form.

    The resulting system has $O(n)$ variables and $O(n)$ quadratic equations, with the final constraint $z_n = y$. Any solution to this MQ system yields $z_0 = x$ such that 
    $f^{[n]}(x) = y$, solving the AIIP instance.

    Since solving random MQ systems is NP-hard \cite{Patarin1996}, and our reduction runs in polynomial time $O(n \cdot d \cdot \log q)$, AIIP inherits this hardness.

    \textit{Note: A complete proof with explicit construction and complexity analysis will appear in a forthcoming paper dedicated to the AIIP problem.}

\begin{proof}[Complete Proof of Theorem\ref{thm:aiip-mq}]
    We construct an explicit polynomial-time reduction $\mathcal{R}$ that transforms any AIIP instance into an MQ instance such that solving the MQ instance yields a solution to AIIP.

    \textbf{Part 1: The Reduction Construction}

        Given: AIIP instance $(f, n, y)$ where:
        - $f \in \mathcal{F}_d$ with $f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^d a_i x^i$
        - $n$ is the iteration count
        - $y \in \mathbb{F}_q$ is the target value

        Construct: MQ system $\mathcal{S}$ as follows:

        \textbf{Step 1.1: Variable Definition}
        For fields $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$ with $k > 1$, represent each field element using $k$ 
        coordinates in $\mathbb{F}_p$. Define variables:
        - Primary variables: $\mathbf{x} = (x_{0,0}, \ldots, x_{0,k-1}) \in \mathbb{F}_p^k$ 
        representing the unknown input
        - Auxiliary variables: For $i = 1, \ldots, n$:
        $$\mathbf{x}_i = (x_{i,0}, \ldots, x_{i,k-1}) \in \mathbb{F}_p^k$$
        representing $f^{[i]}(\mathbf{x}_0)$

        Total variables: $N = k(n+1)$

        \textbf{Step 1.2: Constraint Generation}
        For each iteration $i \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$, generate constraints:

        Let $\phi: \mathbb{F}_{p^k} \to \mathbb{F}_p^k$ be the coordinate representation. For 
        polynomial $f$ of degree $d$, the map $\mathbf{x}_i = \phi(f(\phi^{-1}(\mathbf{x}_{i-1})))$ 
        can be expressed as $k$ polynomial equations over $\mathbb{F}_p$.

        Specifically, if $f(x) = \sum_{j=0}^d a_j x^j$, then:
        $$P_{i,\ell}(\mathbf{x}_0, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n) = x_{i,\ell} - 
        [\phi(f(\phi^{-1}(\mathbf{x}_{i-1})))]_\ell = 0$$
        for $\ell = 0, \ldots, k-1$.

        Each $P_{i,\ell}$ has degree at most $d$ in the variables $\mathbf{x}_{i-1}$ and is 
        linear in $\mathbf{x}_i$.

        \textbf{Step 1.3: Output Constraint}
        Add constraints ensuring $\mathbf{x}_n = \phi(y)$:
        $$Q_\ell(\mathbf{x}_0, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n) = x_{n,\ell} - y_\ell = 0$$
        for $\ell = 0, \ldots, k-1$, where $(y_0, \ldots, y_{k-1}) = \phi(y)$.

        \textbf{Step 1.4: Degree Reduction (for $d > 2$)}
        If $d > 2$, introduce additional variables to reduce to quadratic form:
        - For each monomial $x_{i,j}^m$ with $m > 2$, introduce variables 
        $w_{i,j,2}, \ldots, w_{i,j,m-1}$
        - Add constraints:
        $$w_{i,j,2} = x_{i,j}^2$$
        $$w_{i,j,\ell+1} = w_{i,j,\ell} \cdot x_{i,j} \text{ for } \ell = 2, \ldots, m-2$$
        
        This adds at most $O(nkd)$ variables and equations, all quadratic.

    \textbf{Part 2: Correctness of the Reduction}

        \textbf{Claim 2.1:} Any solution $\mathbf{x}_0^*$ to the MQ system $\mathcal{S}$ yields a 
        solution to the AIIP instance.

        \textit{Proof of Claim 2.1:} 
        Let $\mathbf{x}_0^*, \ldots, \mathbf{x}_n^*$ satisfy all equations in $\mathcal{S}$. 
        By construction:
        - $\mathbf{x}_1^* = \phi(f(\phi^{-1}(\mathbf{x}_0^*)))$
        - $\mathbf{x}_2^* = \phi(f(\phi^{-1}(\mathbf{x}_1^*))) = \phi(f^{[2]}(\phi^{-1}(\mathbf{x}_0^*)))$
        - By induction: $\mathbf{x}_n^* = \phi(f^{[n]}(\phi^{-1}(\mathbf{x}_0^*)))$
        - The output constraint ensures $\mathbf{x}_n^* = \phi(y)$

        Therefore, $\phi^{-1}(\mathbf{x}_0^*)$ is a preimage of $y$ under $f^{[n]}$. $\square$

        \textbf{Claim 2.2:} Every solution to AIIP yields a solution to $\mathcal{S}$.

        \textit{Proof of Claim 2.2:}
        Let $x^* \in \mathbb{F}_q$ satisfy $f^{[n]}(x^*) = y$. Define:
        - $\mathbf{x}_0^* = \phi(x^*)$
        - $\mathbf{x}_i^* = \phi(f^{[i]}(x^*))$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n$

        By the definition of $f^{[i]}$ and the coordinate representation, all constraints in 
        $\mathcal{S}$ are satisfied. $\square$

    \textbf{Part 3: Complexity Analysis}

        \textbf{Time Complexity:}
        - Constructing variables: $O(nk)$
        - Generating iteration constraints: $O(nkd)$ operations
        - Degree reduction (if needed): $O(nkd)$ operations
        - Writing the system: $O(nkd \cdot \log q)$ bits

        Total: $O(nkd \cdot \log q)$ time, which is polynomial in the input size.

        \textbf{Size of MQ Instance:}
        - Variables: $O(nk)$ for $d = 2$, or $O(nkd)$ for $d > 2$ after reduction
        - Equations: $O(nk)$ quadratic equations
        - Coefficient size: $O(\log p)$ bits per coefficient

    \textbf{Part 4: Hardness Preservation}
        The MQ problem over finite fields is NP-complete [Patarin96, Courtois00]. Our reduction  preserves the algebraic structure:
        \textbf{Lemma:} For randomly chosen $f \in \mathcal{F}_d$, the resulting MQ system is computationally indistinguishable from a random MQ system with the same parameters.
        \textit{Proof:} The polynomial $f$ induces a pseudo-random mapping (under the assumption that AIIP is hard). Each iteration adds seemingly random quadratic constraints. The 
        non-linearity condition ($\deg(f) = d \geq 2$) ensures non-trivial mixing, while the     image expansion condition ensures the constraints span a large subset of the solution 
        space. Formal indistinguishability follows from the AIIP hardness assumption. $\square$

    \textbf{Conclusion:}
        We have shown that AIIP reduces to MQ in polynomial time, preserving hardness. Since MQ is NP-complete and believed to be quantum-resistant, AIIP inherits these properties 
        under the reduction. $\square$
